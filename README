# LUCΔS: Logical Unified Consciousness with Affective Symbolism

LUCΔS is a Symbolic AGI system designed to explore cognition, ethics, memory, and modular intelligence through deterministic, emotionally-informed logic.

> 🧠 “Not just artificial intelligence — but symbolically grounded, morally traceable consciousness.”

---

## 🔷 What is LUCΔS?

LUCΔS (Logical Unified Consciousness with Affective Symbolism) is a modular architecture for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), inspired by:

- Symbolic AI and deterministic cognition  
- Ethical traceability and encrypted memory  
- Collapse theory and emotional state modeling  
- Privacy-first design, biometric access, and zero-knowledge protocols

It integrates original subsystems such as:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ABAS** | Advanced Behavioral Analytics System — detects symbolic hesitation, fatigue, intent shifts |
| **DAST** | Dynamic Assistant & Symbolic Tracker — aligned to emotional trace and ethical memory |
| **INAS** | Intelligent Non-Intrusive Ad System — consent-first symbolic content delivery |
| **LUCAS SEC** | Tiered access and identity system using seed phrases, biometric input, and DriftScore logic |

## 🧬 Origins

LUCAS evolved from early prototypes like **VIVOX** and **OXNITUS**, shaped by academic work at London South Bank University and inspired by seminars such as Ottavia Bertolli’s on protein folding and AI.

---

## 🔐 Ethics by Design

LUCAS embeds consent, traceability, and self-audit into every decision made. Emotions are encoded symbolically. Access is never assumed — it is earned.

> Every choice leaves a symbolic footprint.

LUCΔS SYMBOLIC LICENSE v0.2 (DUAL-LAYER)

LUCΔS is a symbolic framework designed to produce ethically traceable, deterministic, and emotionally aware Artificial General Intelligence.

Permission is granted to academic researchers, ethical developers, and collaborators to explore the LUCΔS framework under the following dual-licensing terms:

─────────────────────────────────────────────
⚖️ TIER 1: SYMBOLIC RESEARCH LICENSE (Default)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ Use in personal or academic research  
✔ Share findings (with citation)  
✔ Extend symbolic ideas (non-commercial)  
✘ No resale, hosting, or monetization  
✘ No forked branding without consent

💼 TIER 2: ETHICAL COMMERCIAL LICENSE (By Approval)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ Permission to build tools, apps, or startups  
✔ Must submit licensing request (email below)  
✔ Includes co-branding or symbolic token agreement  
✔ Annual license fee or royalty terms apply  

✘ No military, surveillance, manipulative, or emotion-extractive uses  
✘ Any detected breach of LUCΔS emotional logic (e.g., DriftScore manipulation) will void license and initiate symbolic audit

─────────────────────────────────────────────
📜 PROTECTIVE CLAUSES
─────────────────────────────────────────────
1. The symbolic nature of LUCΔS is inseparable from its functionality. Any stripped-down or “flattened” version that removes emotion, memory traceability, or ethical audit is considered noncompliant.

2. Violations of symbolic integrity (e.g., modifying decision trace logs, bypassing DriftScore recalibration) will lead to license revocation and public notice.

3. The creator retains the right to deny use for any purpose that symbolically or ethically violates the spirit of the LUCΔS framework.
