# LUCΔS: Logical Unified Consciousness with Affective Symbolism

LUCΔS is a Symbolic AGI system designed to explore cognition, ethics, memory, and modular intelligence through deterministic, emotionally-informed logic.

> 🧠 “Not just artificial intelligence — but symbolically grounded, morally traceable consciousness.”

---

## 🔷 What is LUCΔS?

LUCΔS (Logical Unified Consciousness with Affective Symbolism) is a modular architecture for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), inspired by:

- Symbolic AI and deterministic cognition  
- Ethical traceability and encrypted memory  
- Collapse theory and emotional state modeling  
- Privacy-first design, biometric access, and zero-knowledge protocols

It integrates original subsystems such as:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ABAS** | Advanced Behavioral Analytics System — detects symbolic hesitation, fatigue, intent shifts |
| **DAST** | Dynamic Assistant & Symbolic Tracker — aligned to emotional trace and ethical memory |
| **INAS** | Intelligent Non-Intrusive Ad System — consent-first symbolic content delivery |
| **LUCAS SEC** | Tiered access and identity system using seed phrases, biometric input, and DriftScore logic |

## 🧬 Origins

LUCAS evolved from early prototypes like **VIVOX** and **OXNITUS**, shaped by academic work at London South Bank University and inspired by seminars such as Ottavia Bertolli’s on protein folding and AI.

## 🔐 Ethics by Design

LUCAS embeds consent, traceability, and self-audit into every decision made. Emotions are encoded symbolically. Access is never assumed — it is earned.

> Every choice leaves a symbolic footprint.
